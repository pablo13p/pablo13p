## 🧠 About Me

Technology has always been my way of understanding the world.  
Since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how things work that curiosity naturally led me into the world of software development.

I’m currently completing my **Higher Vocational Education in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM)**, after previous training in **Microcomputer Systems and Networks**.  
This path has provided me with a strong foundation in **software engineering, networking, and hardware systems**, allowing me to understand technology from the ground up.

I’ve been working since the age of 16, combining studies and part-time jobs an experience that has taught me **discipline, adaptability, teamwork, and time management**.  
I’m passionate about learning new technologies, writing clean and efficient code, and collaborating on projects that solve real problems.
