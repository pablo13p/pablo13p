## 🧠 About Me

Technology has always been my way to understand the world.  
Since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how things work that curiosity naturally led me into the world of software development.

I’m currently completing my **Higher Vocational Education in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM)**, following my previous training in **Microcomputer Systems and Networks**.  
This background has given me a strong foundation in **software engineering, networking, and hardware systems**, allowing me to understand technology from the ground up.

Working since I was 16 while studying has taught me **discipline, adaptability, teamwork, and time management**.  
I’m passionate about **learning new technologies, writing clean and efficient code**, and **collaborating on meaningful projects** that solve real problems.
